## Deliverable
- Add a new SVG mockup file showing mandatory per‑video monitor assignment with only one start button.

## Mockup Content
- Keep current theme/colors and layout.
- Added Files list shows each video with a compact monitor chip (M0/M1/M2). Clicking cycles monitors.
- “TRAIN ME!” is the only start button:
  - Enabled only when monitors are selected AND all videos are assigned.
  - Disabled state uses reduced opacity and a small lock icon (no labels).
- No other play buttons; Play Per‑Monitor is removed.
- Status area remains minimal; no extra labels.

## File
- Name: `ui-mockup-assign-required.svg`
- Location: project root (`d:\Projects\TrainMeX\TrainMe\`).

## After Approval
- I will add the SVG file and then, if desired, wire this behavior into XAML/C# (assign chips + single start button + gating).
