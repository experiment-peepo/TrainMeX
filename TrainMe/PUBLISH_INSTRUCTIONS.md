# Publishing TrainMeX as Standalone Portable Executable

This document explains how to build TrainMeX as a standalone, portable executable that includes all dependencies and requires no installation.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK installed on your development machine
- Windows operating system (for building Windows executables)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\publish.ps1
```

### Option 2: Using the Batch Script
```cmd
publish.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual Command
```bash
dotnet publish TrainMeX\TrainMeX.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -o publish
```

## Output

After successful build, the standalone executable will be located at:
```
publish\TrainMeX.exe
```

## What Makes It Portable?

1. **Self-Contained**: Includes the .NET 8.0 runtime, so no .NET installation is required on target machines
2. **Single File**: All dependencies are bundled into one executable file
3. **No Installation**: Can be run directly from any folder
4. **Local Settings**: All settings and session data are stored in JSON files alongside the executable

## File Size

The executable will be approximately 50-100 MB as it includes the entire .NET runtime. This is normal for self-contained applications.

## Distribution

Simply copy the `TrainMeX.exe` file to any location. The application will:
- Create `settings.json` in the same directory for user preferences
- Create `session.json` in the same directory for session state
- Work from any folder without requiring installation or registry entries

## Notes

- First launch may be slightly slower due to extraction, but subsequent launches are fast
- The executable is optimized for Windows x64 systems
- All data files are stored relative to the executable location
