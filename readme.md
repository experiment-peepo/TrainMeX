## Usage Guide

### The Launcher
The main window acts as your control center.

- **Assignment Dropdown**: Choose the target monitor for each video.
- **Opacity Slider**: detailed control over video transparency (0% = invisible, 100% = fully opaque).
- **Volume Slider**: Individual audio levels.

### During Playback
- **Active Players**: You'll see a small list of active video windows in the launcher.
- **Control**: You can Pause, Play, or Skip videos directly from the launcher without disturbing the fullscreen playback.
- **Panic Key**: Hit `Ctrl+Shift+End` (configurable in settings) to immediately kill all video windows.
